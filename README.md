# MultiMask

We sincerely think that a wallet only for one blockchain has no future. People use different crypto-currencies and our mission is to make the interaction experience as simple as possible. We are also keen on creating a solution for interoperability by creating a wallet that will support DAPPs across multiple chains. This also means that devlopers and users will be able to access sidechains and layer2 solutions.

MultiMask is browser extension. You can see transaction history and send transaction.
